A client approaches! A local gym has requested that you create a mockup website for them. You will be tasked with creating the site and "delivering" it to the gym owner.  Deliver the GitHub URL here. 

For this assignment, you'll have free reign creatively - we want to see your creativity shine! 

Your task here is to create a small website for a local gym (whatever activity you would like to choose, feel free - rock climbing, swimming, weight lifting, yoga, golf, whatever, as long as it is athleticism and something a local business in your community would offer). 

The site should have at least FOUR pages:

1) a landing page

2) an about page

3) and sign-in and sign-out pages. 

4) Feel free to add more if you want. 

The site should have: 

1) a form

2) a navbar

3) footer 

4) should use either CSS Grid or Bootstrap (Your choice this time) somewhere on the site

4) several images from Unsplash or similar. (Please source your images legally.) 

Tip: If you need inspiration for the layout, try dribbble.com for ideas.

And of course - Have fun with it! One of our goals is for students to fall in love with the act of coding - this is your time to be creative, and practice what you've learned.
